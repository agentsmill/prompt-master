    "description": "Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) uses an LLM to generate prompt variations for a task. Your task is to prompt the LLM to create different ways to ask for a weather forecast.",
    "task": "Generate 5 different ways (prompt variations) a user might ask for the weather forecast for London tomorrow.",
    "prompt_template": "Generate 5 prompt variations with the same meaning as 'What is the weather forecast for London tomorrow?'.\n\nPrompt Variations:",

      "type": "llm_evaluation",
      "evaluation_prompt": "Evaluate the following LLM response. Does it provide at least 3-5 distinct variations for asking about London's weather tomorrow, maintaining the core meaning? Respond with only 'Correct' or 'Incorrect'.\n\nLLM Response:\n{llm_response}",

    "hints": [
      "Clearly state the original prompt/intent ('weather for London tomorrow').",
      "Specify the number of variations desired (e.g., 'Generate 5 variations').",
      "Ensure the core meaning (weather, London, tomorrow) is preserved in the variations.",
      "APE is often used to find the *best* prompt through evaluation, but here we focus on generation."

    "success_message": "Excellent! You used the LLM itself to generate diverse prompt variations, showcasing the APE technique."
